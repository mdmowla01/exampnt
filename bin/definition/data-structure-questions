Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:


1) why do we need data structure?
Ans: 1. To decorate the date efficiently
     2. To search, store, remove data efficiently.
     3. Data is unlimited but memory is limited so for better memory management.

2) List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
  Ans: Array, ArrayList, LinkedList,Stack, Queue,Map, HashMap, LinkedListhashmap, MapTree.

3) what is an Array?
  Ans: Array is an storage structure of data.It stores following by index.The size of the Array must be 
  declared first.
4) what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
 Ans:The size of the array must be determined before but The size of the ArrayList increases as per
    requirement. 


5) what is LinkedList?
   Ans: LinkedList is a data structure by which every element has one value and refference address of 
    outer point as well as inner point.
    Search complexity high but remove complexity low.
6) what is queue?
 Ans: Queue is a data structure whic follow firs come first serve mean FIFO.

7) what is stack?
Stack is a data structure which follows LIFO.

8) what is FIFO and LIFO?
First In First Out
Last In First Out
 
9) what is the order of complexity?
Ans: How many times is needed for calculation of cpu. example how many loop are used in a program.

10)what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans:O(1) means first array is my expected array.

11)what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
O(n), to search my expected element needs to traverse all element.

12) what is tree in data structure?
Ans: Tree is a hierarchial data structre.One node is parent and it has child node with linking wih parent.

13) what is graph in data structure?
Ans: It is a data structure which use many node and connected each other or one anther by randomly

14) what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable stores as per one key and one value;
but hashmap stores the value as one key and one bunch or array of another value;

15) What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS: Array, Queue, Stack,hashmap,MapTree, ArrayList, LikedList
Network data Model: Graph Data Structure
Hierarchical Model: All kind of Tree data Structure;

16) How HashMap works in java?
  It has one key and bunch of array data.
  key is unique;
  ex-usa---->new york, virginia, washington

17)What is Big-(O)-notation?
How much time to execute the algorithm

18)Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Slection sort: O(n^2)
Bubble sort: O(n)
Insertion Sort: O(n)
Shell sort:O(n)

19) Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of adding element.
  b)In terms of removing element.
  c)In terms of searching element.
  
  Adding Element:
  Array:O(1)
  ArrayList:O(n)
  LinkedList:O(1)
  Stack:O(1)
  
  Remove:
  Array:O(n)
  ArrayList:O(n)
  LinkedList:O(1)
  Stack:O(1)
  \
  Searching:
  Array:O(n)
  ArrayList:O(1)
  LinkedList:O(n)
  Stack:O(n)
